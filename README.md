# What is This? 

I'm working on a Python project to write pace notes faster for computer games like DIRT 2.0.

# Why?

I'm very lazy. 

## Documentation




## Installation

Download from GitHub

```cmd
pip install tk
cd (wherever you installed it)
python main.py
```
    
## Roadmap

- Better Look

- ranges between paces (e.g 50, 100, 150)

- Better button management

- Voice Recognition

## Optimizations

There is  a one-file DEV version. It shows just the symbols and doesn't offer the named symbols. Recommended for people who know the ins and outs of pace notes, and don't need the labels.
