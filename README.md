# What is This? 

I'm working on a Python project to write pace notes faster for computer games like DIRT 2.0.

# Why?

I'm very lazy. 

## Documentation




## Installation

Download from GitHub

```cmd
pip install tk
cd (wherever you installed it)
python main.py
```
    
## Roadmap

- Better Look

- ranges between paces (e.g 50, 100, 150)

- Better button management

- Voice Recognition

## Optimizations

There is  a one-file DEV version. It's sluggish, and not recommended for people who don't know the ins and outs of pace notes.
