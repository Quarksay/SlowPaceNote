# What is This? 

Its a python project I'm working on to write pacenotes faster for computer games like DIRT 2.0 .

# Why?

I'm lazy. duh. 

## Documentation




## Installation

Download from Github

```cmd
pip install tkinter
cd (wherever you installed it)
python main.py
```
    
## Roadmap

- Better Look

- ranges between paces (e.g 50, 100, 150)

- Better button management

- Voice Recognition

## Optimizations

There is  a one-file DEV version. It's very lazy, and recommended for people that dont know the ins and outs of pacenotes.
