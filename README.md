# What is This? 

I'm working on a Python project to write pace notes faster for computer games like DIRT 2.0.

# Why?

I'm very lazy, so I made a program to do it for me (kind of) 

## Documentation

## Roadmap

- Better Look

- ranges between paces (e.g 50, 100, 150)

- Better button management

- Voice Recognition

## Optimizations

There is  a one-file DEV version (spn-dev.py). It is the "testing ground" for the roadmap. Currently, it features a new, nicer look. The only downside is that the code is messy.

## Contribution

If you wish to contribute, do so on the contribution branch. If there's something I like, I'll add it. Currently, I need help splitting the one file into other separate files. As much as I like one file, The convenience and modularity matter more.
